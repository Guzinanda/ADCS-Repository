# ADCS-Repository

**Hi fellow traveler & developer!**


I am currently studying a Master Degree in Computer Science.

This repository is part of a master class called "Software Analysis, Design and Construction", here I will be uploading all the code files and exercises developed during this class.

*Feel free to comment anything.*

**Have a nice day! :)**
